The third and definite version of RecNetBot.

RecNetBot is a Discord bot, that utilizes [RecNet](https://rec.net)'s API in fun, useful and creative ways! It's designed to keep you away from the official website as much as possible with its quick and intuitive commands, while also providing you with more information and data. It's useful for quick data gathering, looking up profiles, rooms, images and events, moderation purposes and more. It's a must have for any Rec Room related server out there!
