The third and definite version of RecNetBot.

# About RNB

RecNetBot is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot, that utilizes [RecNet](https://rec.net)'s API in fun, useful and creative ways! It's designed to keep you away from the official website as much as possible with its quick and intuitive commands while also providing you with more information and data. It's useful for quick data gathering, looking up profiles, moderation purposes, rooms, images and events, and more. It's a must have for any Rec Room related server out there!

# Adding the bot
RecNetBot can be invited to your Discord server with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788632031835324456&permissions=322624&scope=bot)! It is the public instance that hundreds of servers use and trust.

Feel free to also self-host RNB! Please know that we won't give you any support as don't have the time to troubleshoot others' issues.
